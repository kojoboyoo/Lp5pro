readme # Sentiment Analysis of COVID Vaccination Tweets with Hugging Face Transformers
 
## Overview
 
This sentiment analysis project leverages state-of-the-art language models, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT, for sentiment classification on tweets related to COVID-19 vaccination. The models are fine-tuned on a labeled dataset, and a Gradio app is developed to provide an interactive interface for sentiment analysis.

## Features
 
- **RoBERTa, BERT, DistilBERT Models:** Utilizes powerful pre-trained models for sentiment analysis, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT.
- **Training Data:** The models are trained on a dataset containing tweets specifically related to COVID-19 vaccination sentiments.
- **Gradio App:** An interactive Gradio app is developed to allow users to input text and obtain sentiment predictions using the RoBERTa model.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** Leverages Hugging Face's Model Hub for easy access to pre-trained language models, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT.
 
## Requirements
 
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages specified in requirements.txt
- Hugging Face Transformers Library
- Gradio Library
 
## Usage
 
Download the datasets used for this project in the dataset folder.
- The dataset consists of tweets collected and classified through Dataset.
- Tweets have been labeled as positive (üëç), neutral (ü§ê), or negative (üëé).
- Usernames and web addresses have been removed for privacy reasons.
